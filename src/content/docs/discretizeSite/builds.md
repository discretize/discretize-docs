The <Specialization name=""/> is a ... introduction to the build, what roll does it fill. Does it generate any useful boons or have any notable skills? Maybe something about the builds playstyle and the fractals it performs well in (and the ones it doesn't).

The section above (or below if you lok at it in the preview window) is generated by the gear optimiser. Once you have generated a build, click the development tab and select the weapons and skills you want to include and copy the code to clipboard, then insert it here. Feel free to change things like sigils, infusions or anything else as required, but consider the impact it might have to the build stats, these should be as accurtate as possible!

This section is used for build notes. Any variations that are commonly made, or additional weapons/sigils that might be needed. Finally a link to check out the [gear optimizer](https://optimizer.discretize.eu/) for more variants.

This is the section for the people who like to read and fully understand the build. Detailed explanations of trait/skill/class iinformation can go here


<Divider text="Rotation / Skill usage"/>
<Warning>

Golem rotations from raid builds are generally suboptimal in fractals due to <Effect name="Exposed"/> and phases being much shorter compared to raids. The raid rotations are optimized for sustained DPS while in fractals a player needs the ability to adapt a rotation to the amount of time a group needs to finish a phase.\
For that reason you can find a video below with openers for each of the CM bosses:

If you have a _Mistlock Singularity_ present you can use this rotation:

If you don't have _Mistlock Singularity_ present you can use this simplified rotation:

Note: The golem benchmark uses a different build setup than the ones above due to its use in raids. Check the description of the benchmark for a link to the build used.
