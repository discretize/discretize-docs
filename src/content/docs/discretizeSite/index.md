Contributing to the Discretize website has never been easier before! All you need to get started is a Github account, a little bit of brain
power, and the ability to read.

## Get started

1. Create a free Github account at [github.com](https://github.com/signup"). The sign-up is free, does not require any personal information except for an e-mail address and should only take 2 minutes.
2. Sign into our CMS (=content management system) at [staging.discretize.eu/cms](https://staging.discretize.eu/cms/) and accept the creation of a fork.
3. Navigate to any site you want to edit.
4. Make your changes, and click "Publish" to save your
   changes. Please be aware that clicking "Publish" does not actually
   publish your changes but saves them. After a review your changes
   will appear first on [staging.discretize.eu](https://staging.discretize.eu) and later on the main website.

## Additional Information

- disable "Sync scrolling" on the very right side of the screen for an optimal experience.
- Adding new sites from the CMS is not possible. Please ask on the
  discord server for help. An admin will create the page for you and
  it will appear in the cms.
- Pictures are not rendering in the cms!

## CMS privacy

The CMS requires access to your full account because it acts on your behalf (oauth). This is a static page, there are no server components and no outgoing requests are made that could possibly steal your oauth token. Your login never leaves your PC.
